# INSIGHTS AND COMMENTS IN MODULE 1:

This Module is the same as the first activity of the last moddule, when we are collecting data form an API (Appicatin Programming Interface).
This API or the 'National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration' NCDC API is the one that being used to this modue.

**First I've learned to understand and read Documentation of a certain API or the items provided to give you knowledge about the software you want to use**
- if i don't know or understand what to do, I refer first to the documentation before going to Internet or an AI.
- think of it as a manual even though some documentation has some overwhelming infoormation to throw at you.
