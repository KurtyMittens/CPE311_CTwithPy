## INSIGHTS AND COMMENTS IN MODULE 1:

This Module is the same as the first activity of the last moddule, when we are collecting data form an API (Appicatin Programming Interface).
This API or the 'National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration' NCDC API is the one that being used to this modue.

**First I've learned to understand and read Documentation of a certain API or the items provided to give you knowledge about the software you want to use**
- if i don't know or understand what to do, I refer first to the documentation before going to Internet or an AI.
- think of it as a manual even though some documentation has some overwhelming infoormation to throw at you.

## INSIGHTS AND COMMENTS IN MODULE 2

Querying in Pandas/Dataframes are easy and easy to remember because of it's similarity in SQL.

**I've Learned that there are two ways to et the query you like/desire**:
1. The Easy DataFrame.query():
   - The query accepts a SQL script as a Parameter.

2. the bitwise Opt Cracker, The Booolean Mask :
   - uses bitwise to get what he/she wanted/desired in the query

**Merging folllows the JOIN in SQL**
- using DataFrame.merge() we can perform Joins such as left, right, inner joins and many more. (Inner Join as the default)

## INSIGHTS AND COMMENTS FOR MODULE 3

This module consists of the basic Operations you can do to your dataframes. The most memorable is these:

## pct_change() 
- lets you change the current number of a column to its percentage equivalent.

## pd.cut(), pd.qcut()
- let youu create seperate bins in order for you to identify the rages/roupings of your data

## .apply()
- lets you apply Functions in certain dataframe or specific coluumn for an easy configurations

## Window calculations
- rolinng calculations can be done using this <-

## INSIGHTS AND COMMENTS FOR MODULE 4

this Aggeration of dataframe is simply formating the data for future use.
can be done uing the agg() function.

but this module alo includes:
## group_by()
- aggreating the groups of a dataframe not the entire dataframe

## pivot_tables
- Provides the simmplest form of aggregation

## crosstabs
- in which you get the frequency of a specific column

## INSIGHTS AND COMMENTS IN MODDULE 5

- basically this module talks about time. Yo can calulate time wiht TimeDelta() andd you can select data from simply inputting the dates/range of dates of the desired data.

- You can also resample your data by the DateTime Index, Period Index, and timedeltaIndex
