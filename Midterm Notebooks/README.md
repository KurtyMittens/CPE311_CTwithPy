- Pandas is a robust Python library that will quickly become your closest friend when it comes to data manipulation. We'll discover how to load data, prepare it for analysis, and clean it up.

- Combining Pandas DataFrames: Data frequently conceals secrets that are just waiting to be discovered. We'll get proficient in pandas' groupby function so you can use it to examine and summarize your data and identify trends and patterns.

- Using pandas, matplotlib, and seaborn for data visualization: Data visualizations give life to your research. To build understandable and instructive charts and graphs, we'll examine the plotting capabilities of pandas and delve into the matplotlib and seaborn libraries.

- Prepare to turn unprocessed data into insightful findings! Let's explore data and explore the world of Jupyter Notebooks!
